#About
This app sets a user account for the user to find a list of personal items that should be meaningful to the user.
This is part of flatiron's school sinatra project. One of the most vital points is that the app has CRUD(create,read,update,destroy) actions.

#Installation
 You can git clone at git@github.com:illusioninlost/personal-items.git and run "bundle install" on the terminal. Using rack system, run "shotgun" to load up local web server.
